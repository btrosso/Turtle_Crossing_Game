***Requirements***
* Move the turtle across the screen using the "UP" key (cant go back/left/right)
* Cars need to be randomly generated along the y-axis and move left across the screen
* When the turtle hits the top edge of the screen, it moves back to the original position and the player levels up.
      On the next level, the car speed increases.
* When the turtle collides with a car, it's game over and everything stops.

***TO DO LIST***
-Done-TODO: 1. start building out the player class - this will be my player turtle
-Done-TODO: 2. create the key-bind for the up arrow to move the turtle
-Done-TODO: 3. start building out the car class, first generate one car at a random point and then get it to move across
-Done-TODO: 4. generate multiple cars at different times and make them move across the screen
-Done-TODO: 5. create the logic for when a turtle hits the top edge of the screen, he gets rest back at the bottom
-Done-TODO: 6. when the turtle gets reset the cars move faster (remember the trick from pong - decrease time.sleep() / *= 0.9
-Done-TODO: 7. detect collision with car
-Done-TODO: 8. create logic for when turtle gets hit game over


---note to self---
when creating multiple cars consider appending to an empty list like ive done before
but use the hideturtle() method and the showturtle() method and check for when the cross the line on the other side
then basically pick them up and move them back to a different random position?
